		<h1> Historical Events in Feminists</h1>
		
		<article>
			<h2>A Brief History</h2>
			<div class="history">
			The history of feminism comprises the narratives (chronological or thematic) of the movements and ideologies which have aimed at equal rights for women. While feminists around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, culture, and country, most Western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Some other historians limit the term "feminist" to the modern feminist movement and its progeny, and use the label "protofeminist" to describe earlier movements.<br />

			Modern Western feminist history is conventionally split into three time periods, or "waves", each with slightly different aims based on prior progress:<br />

			First-wave feminism of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly addressing issues of women's suffrage.<br />

			Second-wave feminism (1960s–1980s) broadened debate to include cultural inequalities, gender norms, and the role of women in society.<br />

			Third-wave feminism (1990s–2000s) refers to diverse strains of feminist activity, seen both as a continuation of the second wave and as a response to its perceived failures.<br />

			Although the "waves" construct has been commonly used to describe the history of feminism, the concept has also been criticized for ignoring and erasing the history between the "waves", by choosing to focus solely on a few famous figures and on popular events.<br />

				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>Feb 3, 1870</th>
					<td>15th Amendment</td>
					<td>The 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution is ratified, stating that "the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." </td>

					<th>1963</th>

				<tr>
					<th>Jun 23, 1972</th>
					<td>Title IX</td>
					<td>The United States Congress enacts a series of Educational Amendments including Title IX, which states that "no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." </td>
